# âœ… **FIXED - Dashboard Link & Owner Redirect Issues**

## ðŸŽ¯ **Issues Fixed:**

### **1. Dashboard Link Visibility**

**Problem**: Dashboard link was showing for ALL logged-in users
**Solution**: âœ… Now only shows for users with `role: "owner"`

**Changes Made:**

- âœ… Added `userRole` state to Navbar component
- âœ… Fetch user role from database when user logs in
- âœ… Only show Dashboard link when `userRole === "owner"`
- âœ… Applied to both desktop and mobile navigation

### **2. Owner Auto-Redirect**

**Problem**: Owners could access home page instead of being redirected to dashboard
**Solution**: âœ… Added automatic redirect for owners

**Changes Made:**

- âœ… Created `OwnerRedirect` component
- âœ… Checks user role on home page load
- âœ… Automatically redirects owners to `/dashboard`
- âœ… Added to home page

### **3. Login Redirect Logic**

**Status**: âœ… Already working correctly

- Admins â†’ `/admin`
- Owners â†’ `/dashboard`
- Visitors â†’ `/` (home page)

## ðŸ§ª **Test the Fixes:**

### **Test 1: Visitor User**

1. Register/Login as visitor (role: "visitor")
2. âœ… Should NOT see Dashboard link in navbar
3. âœ… Should stay on home page after login

### **Test 2: Owner User**

1. Register/Login as owner (role: "owner")
2. âœ… Should see Dashboard link in navbar
3. âœ… Should be redirected to `/dashboard` after login
4. âœ… If they visit home page, should auto-redirect to dashboard

### **Test 3: Admin User**

1. Login as admin
2. âœ… Should be redirected to `/admin`
3. âœ… Should NOT see Dashboard link (admins use admin panel)

## ðŸ“± **Mobile & Desktop**

- âœ… Dashboard link visibility works on both mobile and desktop
- âœ… Mobile menu properly shows/hides Dashboard link based on role
- âœ… Responsive design maintained

## ðŸ”§ **Technical Details:**

### **Navbar Changes:**

```typescript
// Added user role state
const [userRole, setUserRole] = useState<string | null>(null);

// Fetch role when user logs in
const { data: profile } = await supabase
  .from("users")
  .select("role")
  .eq("id", user.id)
  .single();

// Only show dashboard for owners
{
  userRole === "owner" && <Link href="/dashboard">Dashboard</Link>;
}
```

### **Owner Redirect Component:**

```typescript
// Checks user role and redirects owners
if (profile?.role === "owner") {
  router.push("/dashboard");
}
```

## ðŸŽ‰ **Result:**

- âœ… Clean navbar that only shows relevant links
- âœ… Owners automatically go to their dashboard
- âœ… Visitors stay on public pages
- âœ… Better user experience based on role
